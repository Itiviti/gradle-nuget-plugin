# Gradle NuGet Plugin [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ua9pbginenbf1b1u/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gluck/gradle-nuget-plugin/branch/master) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Ullink/gradle-nuget-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Ullink/gradle-nuget-plugin)

This plugin allows to execute NuGet.exe from a gradle build.
It also supports pack & push commands through built-in tasks, nugetPack, nugetPush & nugetRestore.

## nugetPack

You can see this plugin being used for real on [il-repack](https://github.com/gluck/il-repack) project.
(together with msbuild one)

## nugetSpec

    The task is to generate nuspec file by custom configuration

    - Sample usage:

    buildscript {
        repositories {
          mavenCentral()
        }
    
        dependencies {
            classpath "com.ullink.gradle:gradle-nuget-plugin:2.5"
        }
    }
    
    apply plugin:'nuget'

    nuget {
        // nuget.exe version to use, defaults to 3.2.0
        // available versions can be found [here](https://dist.nuget.org/index.html)
        version = '3.2.0'
    }

    nugetSpec {
        // Array, Map and Closure could be used to generate nuspec XML, for details please check NuGetSpecTest 
        nuspec = [
            metadata: [
                title:          'project title',
                authors:        'Francois Valdy',
                // id:          default is project.name
                // version:     default is project.version
                // description: default is project.description
                // ...
            ]
            files: [
                { file (src: 'somefile1', target: 'tools') },
                { file (src: 'somefile2', target: 'tools') }
            ]
        ]
    }

## nugetRestore

    Nuget restore is used to retrieve missing packages before starting the build

    - Sample usage:

    nugetRestore {
        solutionDirectory = path\to\project
        packagesDirectory = location\for\package\restore
    }

    Where
     - solutionDirectory - could either contain the .sln file or the repositories.config file
     - packagesDirectory - used only if a folder with repositories.config is used
